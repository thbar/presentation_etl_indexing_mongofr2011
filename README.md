# MongoDB + Solr

This is the presentation I gave at #mongofr 2011.

Shows how MongoDB can be used for ETL work and Solr for full-text search on top of MongoDB.

To run the presentation:

* Install Ruby and Rubygems
* gem install showoff
* ./start

Thanks to Anthony Eden (for publish a showoff-based presentation) and Scott Chacon (for showoff).
